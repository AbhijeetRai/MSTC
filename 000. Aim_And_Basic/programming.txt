The battery of an electronic device or the small (3V) motor used in an electronic device 
are the mechanism or spare part of it. Mechanism can be used independent of device. 
Use the same mechanism(spare part) in any different device and the purpose remains the same. 

The mechanisms of a lego art are lego pieces. The end user is given all the mechanisms and 
he produces the final lego art. He is bringing together all the mechanisms(lego pieces) in any order he wants. 

When mechanisms of a device are brought together in any order. This is called policy making(programming). 
And the user is called policy maker (programmer). Such devices are programmable devices. 

(Although devices are sold whose mechanisms are not brought together by the end user)
(Such devices are non programmable devices: analog wrist watch).

Mechanism of computer: Hardware level implementation of all fundamental arithmetic, logical, trignometrical, 
inverse trignometrical, exponential, logarithmic, hyperbolic, inverse hyperbolic, data movement and control 
flow management and functions. 
(Hardware level of arithmetic and logical operations). 
Mechanisms are implemented in the CPU. 
Main Memory: Interface provided to combine the mechanisms.

We can bring together mechanism of computer in any order we please, hence we are programmers (policy makers). 
And this activity is programming.
