Principle 1) 
Return value of every system call must be checked for possible failure. 

1% of system calls never fail: getpid(), getuid();

0.5 to 1% system calls return void*. E.g. mmap() | shamat() 
If they succed they return non MULL address, on failure they return NULL

Rest of system calls (98%) return int. E.g. 
open(), read(), write(), readv(), writev(), pread(), 
pwrite(), lseek(), preadv(), pwritev(), close(), dup(), 
dup2() and many more 
If they succed, return is 0, for failure return value is -1
