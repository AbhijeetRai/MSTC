	mov(suffix)	source_operand, destination_operand 
	
	The move instruction is used for data movement 
	It transfers data from source operand to destination 
	Just before and just after move instruction, content of source operand remains same 
	But after move instruction the content of destination operand is overwritten by source operand content 
	Suffix indicates number of bytes to be transferred 
	
	mov(b): 1 byte transfer 
	mov(w): 2 byte transfer 
	mov(l): 4 byte transfer 
	mov(q): 8 byte transfer 
	mov(dqu):16 byte transfer

	We know that operands are of three types. These are 9 combinations between source-dest
	Not all combinations are valid. 

	Rules: 
	1) Size of source and destination operand must be same 
	2) Destination operand cannot be of immediate type (constant)
	3) Both operands cannot be simultaenously memory operands 
	
	Out of 9, only five combinations are valid 
	1) Const, Memory	
	2) Immediate, Register 
	3) Register, Memory
	4) Register, Register 
	5) Memory, Register
