BP is base pointer, SP is stack pointer, and IP is instruction pointer. 
Usually BP is used for preserving space to use local variables. 
SP is used to point the current stack. Although SP can be modified easily, you must be cautious 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BP is base pointer, which points to arguments(since they have no name in assembly) and local variables of functions
IP is instruction pointer pointing to currently executing instruction 
si and di are source and destination registers, which store address of source and destination memory in case of copy paste data 
from one location of memory to another
