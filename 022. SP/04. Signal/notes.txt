Normal termination                          Abnormal termination 

Cleanup is dome                             Cleanup is not done
Carried by exit system call                 Carried by signals only 
0 means success, non zero is failure        Core dump is generated 
stdio buffer is cleared                     stdio buffer is not cleared

Although a process may receive signal at any point. 
A signal is detected only when process is about to leave kernel mode to 
enter into ready to run or blocked or user running mode. Once a signal is detected 
its disposition(action once signal is detected) is carried out. 

Signal to a process can be sent by itself, OS or another process 

There are 32 signals in Unix, 64 in linux and 4 dispositions
For each process in PCB, there is field called sig_mask where 
exits a bit for each signal (32 or 64 bits for 32 or 64 signals)
Respective bit is set to 1 when a signal is received
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say I am a process running in user mode. Next I send myself a signal or CPU sends it. 
I will go into kernel mode to process it. Signal will be detected, 
just before entering into non kernel (ready to run, blocked, user running) mode and disposition 
will be carried

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Signal system calls allows to set disposition of a signal 
and kill system call is used to send signal to a process
