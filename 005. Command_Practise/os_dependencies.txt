Why the assembly code for ubuntu-intel does not work for windows-intel even though processor is same? 

In C code, either we do 
    i) Data definition / data manipulation 
    ii) Input / output 
    iii) use system services (create file, read file)

assembly for data definition and manipulation does not change across os 
but assembly for system services changes across os. 
Hence assembly written for one os does not work on another 
EVEN IF THE PROCESSOR REMAINS THE SAME

Why object file os one os does not run on another? 
Because, assembler gives instruction to static linker 
about implict dynamic linking in the obj file. 

And since assembler varies from os to os, 
object file of one os does not seem to work on another
