It took me 417 days to implement a 
Linux library-esque function: generic_qsort. 
Sounds weird right! 

Well it did take time, not because it was killer 
It was me who took 417 days to clear the 
pre-requisites such as the advanced "C" language, 
computer arithmetic, discrete mathematics 
and bits of computer orgranisation. 

Kernel drains you, 
it takes years to understand the pre-requisites themselves.  
It is a penance. One must understand tasks of OS: 
Process management, memory management, I/O, storage. 
One should have understanding of 
LSP(Linux System Programing), CPU architecutre, device driver. 
Then shall he become eligible to touch the kernel code. 

It takes years of study to unlock 
this domain and probably just less than a decade to master it. 
It is so complex, it will test your patience. 
It does not yield result early at all. 

Can you imagine, handling overhead of advanced C (killer syntax) 
system programming with multithreading, advanced data strucutres, 
memory management, device drivers, peripherals(disk and nics), ASSEMBLY, maths, 
at once and write code mixing all of that in few lines. 

I get fascinated while telling myself, 
"there are people who do it in day to day life". 
And trust me you all, they are no less than superheros. 

For me, 
I have barely built understanding of bits of multiple branches
I do not know, how long is this gonna take. I do not know how soon 
or how much it is gonna pay back. What I do know is, 
"The day it yields result, that is gonna be beautiful."
Linux or Systems at this point have evolved so much:
"they are science as well as they are an art in themselves"
And it takes to achieve expertise in an art. 
Which is why, we keep trying to do it for years & years.
