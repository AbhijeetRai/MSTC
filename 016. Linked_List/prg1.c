/**
 * Life has not been kind to me lately 
 * In feb, Lost my dad, came positive with typhoid and jaundice (lost on win32 3 lecs) recoverd what I missed except win32
 * Joined office in march, wrote 15 thoussand lines of code in 15 days, but no hike since 15 months (joining as fresher)
 * I did not get chance to recover win32, I will do asap, and got detected with anxiety (bp 165+) 
 * I am not able to deduce, how to manage workload, fatigue is exasperating 
 * Since it was so bad fatigue, body was in constant aderaline rush, since my body ran out of it 
 * Did ECG but normal, I do not know what I started thinking last weekend 
 * My girlfriend since 3 years told me I am unaviable and cheated and left 
 * All of this happened in last 2 months (something Is eating me from within, I do not understand what)
 * But I am hopefully better than last week
 * 
 * But it is my 100 % will to stay and survive mstc, and I will do it I have planned my last weekday and weekend days to relieve 
 * But what to do for anxiety, I already lost half battle in dsa and came back to mstc, where will I go if I loose this battle too
 * 
 * Also assembly which you will cover in gokhale sir's class, will be repeated for mstc later
 * I am planning 4 day break from work and study to breathe for myself and my life
