Over time, Computers have evolved so much that they have become complex. 
The underlying electronics and mathematics are abstract from users or even programmers.

Thus, I am on an expedition to understand, explore and innovate computing. 
The journey looks to be exhausting. But I am an embodiment of patience. 
Alas! Rome was not built in a day. So why rush? Good things take time. 

And I am no retard. I have made some progress. 
For example, when SEG_FAULT occurs in a C program running on the Windows Operating System. 
The terminal does not show or print anything. It remains indifferent. 
Windows unlike the Linux would not make it explicit for the programmer that a SEG_FAULT has occurred in the code. 
However, the cursor on terminal would blink in some 'weird' way. 
The cursor goes on and off for a tiny fraction of a second. (This is observed with repeatitions).

I am no winner, no champion. But, just a looser who knows to try again and again. 
So far, I have typed so many memory mapping codes. I have made many 'mistakes' while mapping, accessing or freeing the memory. 
Even if Windows does not tell me that a SEG_FAULT has occured somewhere in the code. 
**Even if my code has no print statement**, even if Windows prints nothing on the terminal 
I will wait for the cursor to blink (probably in that weird way). 
I can instantly point out whether a SEG_FAULT has occured  based on the behaviour of the blinking cursosr. 

Well, The world of the computing is so vast. It might not even be the beginning of the quest, the voyage or the expedtition. 
But this is the level of one-ness(unity) I aspire to acquire with the computer. 
This is the level of expertise I want to train for
